# Data-analytics-with-Python-on-vehicle-dataset.
This is the project which I done in my data analytic with Python internship. In this project I perform different data analytics operation on vehicle data set to get information about that dataset..
Vehicle Data Analytics Project
This repository contains a Python-based data analytics project focused on a comprehensive vehicle dataset. The project aims to explore, analyze, and visualize various aspects of vehicle data to derive meaningful insights. Key features of the project include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and patterns using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance model performance.
Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict vehicle attributes such as price, fuel efficiency, and maintenance costs.
Result Interpretation: Evaluating model performance and interpreting key findings.
Key Components
data/: Contains the vehicle dataset in CSV format.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step data analysis and modeling process.
src/: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
README.md: Comprehensive project documentation.
Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
